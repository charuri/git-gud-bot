## Getting Started
1. `git clone <repo>`
2. `npm i`
`npm install discord.io`
`npm install gaussian`
3. Create `credentials.json` in root folder
`{"token":"<user-token>", "channelID": "<channelID>"}`
In order to get user-token, login to web discord, open up dev console, under applications tab, local storage, copy the token.
In order to get the channelID, go into your Discord settings, Appearance menu, and enable Developer Mode. You should be able to see the ID when you right-click a channel now.
